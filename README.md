# Welcome to Hypernova (Finished)

Hypernova is a project by the Mojang team and the upcoming 1.20 update aims to decode the code into a better format for faster and more reliable usage. This project will probably take months as a 3-6 month project. I'm working on some final preparations before importing into Minecraft this weekend.

## What is the Hypernova Project

Hypernova is a project described by Michael Weilbacher of M4ximumPizza on Aug 25, 2022, but started a day later on Aug 26, 2022 at 16:00 PST. These will be fixed/improved by Hypernova.

     Rewrote the Minecraft commands from C++ to Java.
     Fixed many bugs such as data and loading errors with the code.
     3 different coding languages of Java, CSS, and finally HTML.
     Updated the Mojang Website

### Command Properties 

The code before the project was written in C++ and is fairly compact but not fast. After this project started, I rewrote it from C++ to Java. Java is much cleaner and faster to use. It took about half a month to repair and rewrite nearly 100 files. Fully finalized outside of Github on November 5th.

### Bug Fixes

The bug fixes is what took the longest because some were super complex to fix such as [DataFix](https://github.com/M4ximumPizza/Hypernova/blob/master/Fixes/schema/Datafixers.java) and so on from there. But it was finished on November 11th 2022.

### Mojang Website
I just fixed several bugs with it and updated the looks/outdated parts of it.

This project will 'NOT' be released to the public as a download.

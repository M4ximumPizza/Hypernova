# Welcome to Hypernova (Almost Finished)

Hypernova is a project by the Mojang team that is for the upcoming 1.20 update to decypher the code into a better format to run it into a faster, more reliable use.  This project will take several months as perhaps 3-6 month project.

## What is the Hypernova Project

Hypernova is a project that was instructed by Michael Weilbacher for M4ximumPizza to make on Aug 25th 2022 but was started one day later on Aug 26th 2022 at 4:00PM PST. These are what Hypernova is fixing/improving.

     Rewrote the Minecraft commands from C++ to Java.
     Fixed many bugs such as data and loading errors with the code.
     3 different coding languages of Java, CSS, and finally HTML.
     Updated the Mojang Website

### Command Properties 

The codes before the project were written in C++ which is pretty compact but not fast. So when this project was started, I rewrote it from C++ to java which looks more organized/faster use. It took about 1 1/2 months to rewrite with the almost one-hundred files that were fixed.

### Bug Fixes

The bug fixes is what took the longest because some were super complex to fix such as [DataFix](https://github.com/M4ximumPizza/Hypernova/blob/master/Fixes/schema/Datafixers.java).

### Everything else

Working on some final preperations before being done this weekend. 

This project will 'NOT' be released to the public as a download.

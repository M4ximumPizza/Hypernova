# What is the Hypernova Project

Hypernova is a program that will be used by the Mojang team that will work with the 1.20 update and beyond to decipher the code into a better format to run it into a faster, more reliable use. This project is going to be a 6-12 month project while it was instructed by Michael Weilbacher for M4ximumPizza to make on Aug 25th 2022 but was started one day later on Aug 26th 2022 at 4:00PM.

This project will 'NOT' be released to the public as a download.

     Rewrote the Minecraft commands from C++ to Java code.
     Created a Minecraft block/entity properties page.
     Fixed many bugs with the code format and glitches.
     3 different coding languages of Java, C++, and JSON format.

### Terminal Properties 

C++ Terminal was made on October 6th 2022 which will run different commands for the newest update. The terminal it self was orginally written in Python but was changed to C++ while the commands are written in Java code. All the command code will be in the Commands folder in Main.

### Everything else

Working on some final preperations before being done this weekend.

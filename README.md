# Welcome to Hypernova (Almost Finished)

Hypernova could be a project by the Mojang team that's for the coming 1.20 update to decypher the code into a higher robust|an improved} format to run it into a faster, more reliable use.  This project can take many months as maybe 3-6 month project. engaged on some final preperations before being foreign in Minecraft this weekend.

## What is the Hypernova Project

Hypernova is a project that was instructed by Michael Weilbacher for M4ximumPizza to make on Aug 25th 2022 but was started one day later on Aug 26th 2022 at 4:00PM PST. These are what Hypernova is fixing/improving.

     Rewrote the Minecraft commands from C++ to Java.
     Fixed many bugs such as data and loading errors with the code.
     3 different coding languages of Java, CSS, and finally HTML.
     Updated the Mojang Website

### Command Properties 

The codes before the project were written in C++ that is pretty compact however not fast. thus once this project was started, I rewrote it from C++ to java which appearance a lot of organized/faster use. It took about one 1/2 months to rewrite with the just about one-hundred files that were fixed. It absolutely was finished on Nov fifth when it was foreign to github.

### Bug Fixes

The bug fixes is what took the longest because some were super complex to fix such as [DataFix](https://github.com/M4ximumPizza/Hypernova/blob/master/Fixes/schema/Datafixers.java) and so on from there. But it was finished on November 11th 2022.

### Mojang Website
I just fixed several bugs with it and updated the looks/outdated parts of it.

This project will 'NOT' be released to the public as a download.
